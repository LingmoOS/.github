# Lingmo OS Organization

## Hi Cutefish regression in another form. ðŸ‘‹
Lingmo GNU/Linux (Lingmo OS) is a operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux. It offers a beautiful Desktop environment, includes software tailored for this environment, and features a unified UI style. Lingmo OS aims to provide a smooth and visually appealing desktop experience.

### Lightweight and Smooth Experience
Lingmo OS can run on low-performance hardware, offering a lighter and smoother experience than heavy desktop operating systems like Windows 11. Its lightweight nature ensures a fast and enjoyable user experience, making it an ideal choice for both newcomers and seasoned Linux enthusiasts.

### Built-in Spark App Store
Enhancing the ease of use, Lingmo OS comes with the built-in Spark App Store, enabling users to effortlessly discover and install essential applications without needing to use the command line. This user-friendly feature simplifies software management, making it easier than ever to keep your system up-to-date and equipped with the tools you need.
