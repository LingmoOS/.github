# Lingmo OS Organization

## Hi Cutefish regression in another form. ðŸ‘‹
Lingmo GNU/Linux (Lingmo OS) is a operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux, [Arch Linux](https://github.com/orgs/LingmoOS/projects/6)(currently WIP) and [NixOS](https://github.com/LingmoOS-Testing/lingmo-nix)(completely unusable at this time). It offers a beautiful Desktop environment, includes software tailored for this environment, and features a unified UI style. Lingmo OS aims to provide a smooth and visually appealing desktop experience on low-performance hardware.

### Lightweight and Smooth Experience
Lingmo OS can run on low-performance hardware, offering a lighter and smoother experience than desktop operating systems like Windows.

### Built-in Spark App Store
To improve the user experience, Lingmo OS includes the Spark App Store, allowing users to download necessary software without using the command line.
